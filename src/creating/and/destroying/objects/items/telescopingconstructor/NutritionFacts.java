/**
 * Telescoping constructor pattern - does not scale well, this is anti-pattern!
 *
 * What's the project with that?
 * The problem with this (anti)pattern is that once your class has to much constructors
 * and constructors are 4 or more parameters long it becomes difficult to
 * remember the required order of the parameters as well as what particular
 * constructor you might want in a given situation.
 * Giving yourself and your fellow developers a hard time trying to initialize that class.
