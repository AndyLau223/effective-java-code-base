# Creating and Destroying Objects

THIS chapter concerns creating and destroying objects: when and how to create them, when and how to avoid creating them, how to ensure they are destroyed in a timely manner, and how to manage any cleanup actions that must precede their destruction.

## Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

Providing a static factory method instead of a public constructor has both advantages and disadvantages.

One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they have names. If the parameters to a constructor do not, in and of themselves, describe the object being returned, a static factory with a well-chosen name is easier to use and the resulting client code easier to read.

For example, the constructor BigInteger(int, int, Random), which returns a BigInteger that is probably prime, would have been better expressed as a static factory method named BigInteger.probablePrime. (This method was added in Java 4.)

A second advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked.

A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type.

A fourth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.

A fifth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object need not exist when the class containing the method is written.

The main limitation of providing only static factory methods is that classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed.
